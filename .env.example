# ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
# ================================
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your values
# Never commit .env.local to version control

# ================================
# API CONFIGURATION
# ================================

# Backend API Base URL
# This is the base URL for all API calls from the frontend
# REQUIRED: Must be set for production deployment
# 
# For local development:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
#
# For production (example):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://bhaag-dilli-bhaag-backend.onrender.com
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# ================================
# NOTES
# ================================
# 
# 1. NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix:
#    - Variables with this prefix are exposed to the browser
#    - They are embedded in the JavaScript bundle at build time
#    - Never put secrets in NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables
#
# 2. Environment-specific files:
#    - .env.local - Local development (gitignored)
#    - .env.production - Production build
#    - .env.development - Development build
#
# 3. Vercel deployment:
#    - Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
#    - Go to: Project Settings → Environment Variables
#    - Add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL with your production backend URL
#
# 4. Build-time vs Runtime:
#    - NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are replaced at BUILD time
#    - Changing them requires a rebuild
#    - For runtime config, use server-side environment variables
